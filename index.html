        <p class="intro">
          Hello! My name is <strong><em>Tyson Lackey</em></strong>. I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon and have lived here most of my life. 
          There were a couple of years spent at Oregon State University in Corvallis, but other that, Metro Portland has
          always been home. <em>Lacrosse</em> was a huge passion of mine growing up and I played through middle school and high school.
          I decided to stop playing competitively after graduating so I could focus on the full college experience instead of
          being consumed by sports 24/7. I was pursuing a business degree from Oregon State and Portland State depending 
          (bouncing between the two from 2008-2011) before deciding that a 4-year university wasn't for me. After leaving school
          and a few years of working at a netflix call center, a career in Business Intelligence focused in the Logistics field 
          kind of fell into my lap. Working as a junior analyst taught me most of my background in SQL, Power Query, and Power BI.
          A few years into that field, I realized that I wanted to cement a better foundation in my development skills and possibly
          pursue a new career in coding. If nothing else, learning code would supplement a career in BI better than any on the job
          tricks I would pick up along the way. Fate seemed to notice my shift in interests and my job was outsourced in August of 2019
          creating a perfect opportunity to dive head first into this new field and skillset. If I'm not working, I'm almost always playing
          video games. While I have a passion for travel and the outdoors, recent events have definitely forced more of my recreation
          onto the computer or television. Luckily, <em>golf</em> courses have been quick to implement strict social distancing rules and remain open.
          As the weather continues to improve, I plan on spending as much time as possible on the links trying to shake off almost a year's worth of rust.
